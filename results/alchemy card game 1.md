[>] Create a new trading card game with the theme of alchemy.
  [X] Develop the game's core mechanics, such as resource management, card types, and win conditions
    % Result: In the alchemy-themed trading card game, players use a resource called "Essence" to cast spells and summon creatures called "Transmutations." Cards are divided into four categories: Alchemists, Transmutations, Formulas, and Catalysts. Alchemists generate Essence, while Transmutations are creatures with unique abilities that can attack and defend. Formulas are spells that create powerful effects, and Catalysts are artifacts that grant passive bonuses. The win condition is to reduce the opponent's Life Points to zero or to complete the Magnum Opus by collecting the four Elemental Essences stored in each player's deck.
  [X] Design the game's visual theme and card layout, incorporating alchemical symbols and artwork
    % Result: The game's visual theme is inspired by medieval alchemy, featuring intricate illustrations and alchemical symbols. Card backgrounds consist of aged parchment with metallic accents in gold, silver, and bronze, representing the different rarities of cards. The card layout includes an ornate border and a central illustration depicting the card's subject in a detailed, hand-drawn style. Alchemical symbols are used to represent the card's Essence cost, as well as any Elemental Essences associated with the card. The card's name, type, and effect text are displayed in a stylized, antique font, while stats for Transmutations (attack and defense) are displayed in a separate, easily readable box. The overall design evokes a sense of mystery and wonder, immersing players in the world of alchemy.
  [X] Create a balanced and diverse set of cards, including alchemical ingredients, equipment, and processes
    % Result: The initial card set consists of 100 cards, offering a diverse range of Alchemists, Transmutations, Formulas, and Catalysts. Alchemists are based on historical and mythical figures, each with unique abilities to generate Essence and influence gameplay. Transmutations include various mythical creatures and elemental beings, each with unique abilities and elemental affinities. Formulas depict alchemical processes like Calcination, Dissolution, and Coagulation, offering strategic effects such as board control, card draw, or life gain. Catalyst cards represent alchemical equipment like the Alembic, Crucible, and Mortar and Pestle, providing passive bonuses to aid players in achieving their goals. The card set is designed to promote strategic deck-building and diverse gameplay, with an emphasis on synergy between cards and creative combinations.
  [X] Develop a game rulebook explaining how to play, including setup, turn structure, and resolving card effects
    % Result: The game rulebook begins with an introduction to the alchemy-themed trading card game, its components, and the objective of reducing the opponent's Life Points to zero or completing the Magnum Opus. The setup section explains how to construct a deck of 40 cards, shuffle, and draw an initial hand of 5 cards, with each player starting at 20 Life Points.

The turn structure is divided into six phases: 1) Essence Generation, where Alchemists generate Essence for the turn; 2) Draw, where the active player draws a card; 3) Main Phase 1, where players can summon Transmutations, cast Formulas, and activate Catalysts by paying their Essence costs; 4) Combat Phase, where Transmutations can attack the opponent or their Transmutations; 5) Main Phase 2, where players can perform additional actions similar to Main Phase 1; and 6) End Phase, where effects ending this turn are resolved, and the turn passes to the opponent.

The rulebook also contains a section on resolving card effects, detailing the order of operations when multiple effects trigger simultaneously and explaining how to handle specific interactions between cards. Additionally, it includes a glossary of common terms and symbols used in the game, as well as a brief guide on deck-building strategies and tips for new players.
