[>] Design the rules for a new stategic card game about cryptography and politics.
  [X] Determine the number of players and game objective
    % Result: The game will accommodate 2 to 6 players. The objective is to accumulate the most influence points by decrypting secret messages, forming political alliances, and completing covert missions before the game ends.
  [X] Define the card types and their roles in the game
    % Result: There are four card types in the game: Message cards, Cipher cards, Politician cards, and Mission cards. Message cards contain encrypted information that players must decrypt using Cipher cards. Cipher cards represent various decryption techniques that players can use to decode messages. Politician cards represent political figures that players can form alliances with to gain influence and special abilities. Mission cards are secret objectives that players must complete to earn influence points and trigger game-changing effects.
  [X] Create a deck-building mechanism
    % Result: At the beginning of the game, each player receives a starter deck of 10 cards, consisting of 3 Cipher cards, 3 Politician cards, and 4 Message cards. During each turn, players can purchase new cards from a shared market using influence points. The market consists of a face-up selection of 5 cards, which are replaced with new cards from the main deck whenever a card is purchased. Players may also trade cards with other players to strengthen their decks. When a player's deck runs out, they shuffle their discard pile to create a new deck, allowing for strategic deck-building throughout the game.
  [X] Establish the rules for card interactions and gameplay
    % Result: Players take turns in clockwise order. On their turn, a player may perform up to 3 actions: Draw a card, Play a card, or Purchase/Trade a card. Drawing a card means taking the top card from their deck into their hand. Playing a card involves using a Cipher card to decrypt a Message card, forming an alliance with a Politician card, or attempting to complete a Mission card. To decrypt a message, the player must match the Cipher card's decryption technique with the appropriate Message card. Successfully decrypting a message grants influence points and may reveal additional actions or effects. Forming alliances with Politician cards requires the player to discard a specific combination of cards from their hand. In return, the player gains influence points and a special ability unique to that politician. To complete a Mission card, the player must meet the requirements listed on the card and discard the necessary cards. Completing a mission grants influence points and may trigger game-changing effects. Purchasing or trading cards is done by spending influence points or exchanging cards with other players. The game ends when the main deck is depleted or a player reaches a predetermined influence point threshold. The player with the most influence points wins.
  [X] Design a scoring system and win conditions
    % Result: The scoring system is based on influence points, which players accumulate throughout the game. Influence points are gained by decrypting Message cards (1-3 points), forming alliances with Politician cards (2-5 points), and completing Mission cards (3-8 points). Each Politician card also provides a unique end-game bonus, based on the alliances and accomplishments of the player during the game (1-4 points). The game ends when one of the following conditions is met: the main deck is depleted, a player reaches 50 influence points, or a predetermined number of Mission cards have been completed. The player with the most influence points, including end-game bonuses, is declared the winner.
  [X] Integrate cryptography elements into the game mechanics
    % Result: To integrate cryptography elements, Message cards will feature encrypted text using various well-known ciphers (e.g., Caesar cipher, VigenÃ¨re cipher, or substitution cipher). Cipher cards will indicate the decryption technique required to decode the corresponding Message card. Players must identify the correct Cipher card to use on a Message card, and then decrypt the message to gain influence points and reveal additional effects. Some Mission cards may involve decrypting a series of messages or discovering weaknesses in opponents' ciphers, adding a layer of cryptographic strategy to gameplay. Additionally, certain Politician cards could grant abilities related to cryptography, such as providing hints for decryption or allowing the player to intercept and decrypt other players' messages.
  [X] Incorporate political aspects, such as alliances and negotiation, into the gameplay
    % Result: To incorporate political aspects, players can form alliances with Politician cards by discarding specific card combinations from their hand. Each Politician card grants a unique ability and end-game bonus, promoting negotiation and strategic decision-making. Players can also engage in diplomacy by trading cards, forming temporary alliances, and sharing decryption resources with other players. Some Mission cards may require players to collaborate or negotiate with others to achieve common goals, further emphasizing the importance of political maneuvering. Additionally, certain Message cards might contain sensitive political information, giving players the option to use this knowledge to their advantage, either by blackmailing opponents or leveraging it in negotiations for better trade deals or alliances.
