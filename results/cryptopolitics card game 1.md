    [X] Decide on the minimum and maximum number of players for the game
      % Result: The game can be played by a minimum of 2 players and a maximum of 6 players.
    [X] Create the main objective or goal of the game, incorporating elements of cryptography and politics
      % Result: The main objective of the game is for players to collect and decrypt secret messages while strategically forming alliances and betraying opponents in order to gain political power and ultimately control the most territories on the game board by the end of the game.
  [X] Create a basic structure for gameplay, including turn order and actions
    [X] Determine the components of a player's turn
      % Result: A player's turn consists of four phases: (1) Draw Phase, where the player draws a card from the main deck; (2) Decryption Phase, where the player attempts to decrypt a secret message in their possession using collected decryption keys; (3) Action Phase, where the player can perform actions such as forming alliances, betraying opponents, or playing special cards to influence the game board; and (4) Territory Control Phase, where the player may claim or reinforce territories based on their political power and decrypted messages. Turn order proceeds clockwise.
    [X] Establish the order in which players take their turns
      % Result: The order in which players take their turns is determined by drawing a numbered card from a separate deck at the beginning of the game. The player with the lowest numbered card goes first, followed by the player with the next lowest numbered card, and so on. Turn order proceeds clockwise from the starting player.
    [X] Define the types of actions players can take during their turn
      % Result: During their turn, players can take the following types of actions: (1) Form Alliance, where a player can propose an alliance with another player to share resources or work together; (2) Betray Alliance, where a player can break an existing alliance, potentially stealing resources or weakening an opponent's position; (3) Play Special Card, where a player can use a card from their hand to perform a unique action, such as gaining decryption keys, influencing political power, or disrupting opponents' plans; (4) Claim Territory, where a player can use their political power to claim an unoccupied territory on the game board; and (5) Reinforce Territory, where a player can strengthen their control over an existing territory by investing additional political power.
    [X] Decide how turns and actions will affect the game's objective and overall strategy
      % Result: Turns and actions affect the game's objective and overall strategy as follows: Players must balance their resources and political power while forming and breaking alliances to stay ahead of their opponents. Successfully decrypting secret messages can provide valuable information, advantages, or additional political power, which can be used strategically to claim and reinforce territories. The dynamic nature of alliances and betrayals adds a layer of unpredictability, requiring players to adapt their strategies and maintain a strong position on the game board to achieve the ultimate goal of controlling the most territories by the end of the game.
  [X] Design card types related to cryptography and politics, such as encryption methods, decryption tools, political figures, and events
    [X] Create a list of encryption method cards that players can use to encode secret messages
      % Result: The encryption method cards include: (1) Caesar Cipher, which shifts the letters of the message by a fixed number; (2) Vigenère Cipher, which uses a keyword to shift letters in the message; (3) Transposition Cipher, which rearranges the letters in the message according to a predetermined pattern; (4) Playfair Cipher, which encrypts pairs of letters using a 5x5 grid; (5) One-Time Pad, which uses a unique, random key to encrypt the message; (6) Enigma Machine, which simulates a complex series of rotor-based substitutions; and (7) RSA Encryption, which uses mathematical principles and public/private key pairs for secure communication. Players can use these encryption methods to create secret messages and potentially hinder opponents' decryption efforts.
    [X] Design decryption tool cards that players can collect to help them decrypt secret messages
      % Result: The decryption tool cards include: (1) Frequency Analysis, which helps players identify common letters in a cipher based on their frequency; (2) Keyword Discovery, which reveals a keyword used in a Vigenère Cipher or Playfair Cipher; (3) Reverse Transposition, which provides the pattern needed to undo a Transposition Cipher; (4) Codebook, which contains solutions to specific Caesar Ciphers or other simple substitution ciphers; (5) One-Time Pad Key, which provides the unique, random key needed to decrypt a One-Time Pad encrypted message; (6) Enigma Machine Blueprint, which provides the settings and rotor configurations necessary to decrypt an Enigma Machine-encrypted message; and (7) Private Key, which allows players to decrypt messages encrypted with RSA Encryption. Collecting these decryption tool cards will enable players to decode secret messages, gaining valuable information, advantages, or political power to use strategically in the game.
    [X] Develop a set of political figure cards that players can use to gain unique abilities or advantages
      % Result: The political figure cards include: (1) Diplomat, which allows a player to form alliances more easily or negotiate better terms; (2) Spy, which enables a player to steal or peek at an opponent's secret message or decryption tool card; (3) Propagandist, which grants a player the ability to increase their political power or decrease an opponent's political power; (4) Military General, which strengthens the player's control over claimed territories or weakens an opponent's control; (5) Cryptanalyst, which improves the player's chances of successfully decrypting secret messages; (6) Double Agent, which allows a player to infiltrate an alliance and gain access to shared resources or information; and (7) Head of State, which provides a unique, powerful ability that can significantly influence the game board or players' positions. These political figure cards can be used strategically to gain advantages and influence the outcome of the game.
    [X] Design event cards that can change the game's landscape or affect players' strategies
      % Result: The event cards include: (1) International Summit, which forces all players to reveal their alliances and potentially renegotiate terms; (2) Espionage Scandal, which causes a random player to lose a decryption tool or secret message due to an information leak; (3) Political Upheaval, which shuffles the control of territories on the game board, altering players' positions; (4) Breakthrough in Cryptography, which allows all players to draw a new decryption tool card; (5) Military Coup, which disrupts the balance of power, causing players with the most territories to lose some control; (6) Diplomatic Crisis, which forces players to choose between maintaining alliances or gaining additional political power; and (7) Intelligence Agency Raid, which enables a player to target an opponent and steal one of their cards, be it a secret message, decryption tool, or political figure.
