  [X] Create a futuristic setting and describe the society
    % Result: The story is set in a sprawling Martian metropolis called New Utopia, a marvel of advanced technology and architectural innovation. The society is governed by an AI called The Overseer, which ensures fair distribution of resources and maintains social harmony. Citizens are grouped into various professional guilds based on their skills and interests, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.

  [X] Define the rules and limitations of immortality in this world
    % Result: In this world, immortality can be achieved through two primary methods: genetic modification and consciousness transfer. Genetic modification involves altering an individual's DNA to halt the aging process, granting biological immortality. However, this method does not protect individuals from accidents or diseases. Consciousness transfer allows individuals to upload their minds into advanced android bodies, protecting them from biological limitations but at the cost of losing their original human form. Both methods have limitations: genetic modification is accessible only to the elite due to its high cost and limited availability, while consciousness transfer raises ethical concerns about the true nature of identity and humanity. Additionally, immortality is regulated by The Overseer, which imposes strict quotas to prevent overpopulation and the depletion of resources, forcing individuals to make difficult choices about who gets to live forever.
