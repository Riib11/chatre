            % The futuristic setting and location of the story allow for the exploration of advanced technological means of achieving immortality, such as neural uploading or genetic modification. Additionally, the isolation of living on a space station for extended periods of time could also bring new perspectives on the psychological and social effects of immortality.
        [X] Establish whether immortality is a widely available technology or a rare occurrence
          [X] Establish whether immortality is a widely available technology or a rare occurrence.
            % Result: In this story, immortality is a widely available technology that has become the norm for the wealthy elite who can afford the expensive procedures. However, there are still those who choose to live a natural life and accept death as a part of the human experience.

            % Understood. If immortality is widely available, what is the reason for the protagonist to seek it out?
          [X] Result: Immortality is a widely available technology that has become the norm in human society. People can choose to live forever through various means, such as neural uploading, genetic modification, or regeneration technology. However, this has led to overpopulation and resource depletion, as people refuse to die and make way for future generations. The story could focus on the consequences of this societal shift, and whether it is sustainable in the long run.
            % Understood. However, my question was about the reason for the protagonist to seek immortality, assuming it's already available. Could you please provide more information on the protagonist's motivation?

            % Understood. Thank you for the clarification.
        [X] Determine the societal and cultural norms surrounding immortality, including any potential conflicts or divisions between immortal and mortal populations.
          [X] Society views immortality as the ultimate goal and a symbol of success, leading to a divide between the immortal elite and the mortal population.
            % The immortal elite have access to the best resources and opportunities, while the mortal population is seen as expendable and replaceable. This has led to resentment and conflict between the two groups, with some mortals seeking to overthrow the immortal ruling class. Additionally, there are cultural norms surrounding immortality, such as the expectation that immortals will continue to contribute to society and advance human progress, rather than simply living for their own pleasure. The story could explore the consequences of such societal and cultural norms, and whether they are ultimately beneficial or harmful to humanity as a whole.
          [X] The mortal population is seen as inferior and disposable, leading to conflicts and tensions between the two groups.
            % The immortal elite view themselves as superior to the mortal population, and often exploit their resources and labor to maintain their own power and wealth. This has led to a growing resistance movement among the mortals, who seek to overthrow their immortal oppressors and establish a more equal society. However, there are also those among the mortal population who aspire to immortality themselves, and are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve it. The story could explore the moral and ethical implications of such a divided society, and whether it is possible to bridge the gap between the immortal and mortal populations.
          [X] Immortality has become a status symbol, with the wealthy and powerful flaunting their eternal life and luxury lifestyles.
            % The societal pressure to achieve immortality has led to a culture of excess and hedonism among the immortal elite, who view their eternal life as a license to indulge in whatever pleasures they desire. This has created a stark contrast between the opulence of the immortal elite and the struggles of the mortal population, who are often forced to work long hours in menial jobs just to survive. The story could explore the psychological toll of such a lifestyle, and whether true fulfillment and happiness can be achieved through immortality and material wealth alone.
          [X] However, there are still those who reject immortality and choose to live a natural life, leading to a counterculture movement that challenges the societal norm.
            % Despite the pressure to achieve immortality, there are still those who reject it and choose to live a natural life. This counterculture movement challenges the societal norm and views immortality as a form of hubris and an affront to the natural cycle of life and death. They believe that mortality gives life its meaning and value, and that the pursuit of eternal life is ultimately futile and destructive. The story could explore the conflict between these two ideologies, and whether there can be a middle ground between the desire for eternal life and the acceptance of mortality.
