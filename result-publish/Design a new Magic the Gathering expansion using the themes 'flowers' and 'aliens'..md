  - Develop the mechanics and abilities for each card, maintaining balance and synergy between them
    Result: 

1. Cosmic Orchid: Teleport - Costs 3 energy tokens. Move your spaceship to any unoccupied location on the board. This ability can only be used once every 3 turns to maintain balance.

2. Nebula Nectar: Energy Harvest - At the start of your turn, place 1 energy token on this card. Spend 2 energy tokens from this card to gain 1 additional energy token for your spaceship. Maximum of 4 energy tokens can be stored on Nebula Nectar.

3. Extraterrestrial Tulip: Alien Snare - Costs 4 energy tokens. Target an opponent's card within 2 spaces of your spaceship. Gain control of that card until the end of your next turn. This ability has a 2-turn cooldown.

4. Stellar Sunflower: Solar Regeneration - At the start of your turn, heal 1 health point for every 2 energy tokens on this card. Spend 2 energy tokens to instantly heal 2 health points with a 3-turn cooldown.

5. Galactic Garden: Resource Cultivation - Place this card on an unoccupied location on the board. Each turn, you may harvest 1 resource from the garden. Opponents can also harvest resources from the garden, promoting strategic positioning and competition.

6. Interstellar Iris: Starlight Barrier - Costs 2 energy tokens. Gain a shield that blocks the next incoming attack. The shield lasts for 2 turns. This ability has a 3-turn cooldown to prevent constant shielding.

7. Lunar Lotus: Lunar Insight - Costs 2 energy tokens. Reveal the top 3 cards of an opponent's deck or reveal a hidden card on the board. This ability has a 2-turn cooldown.

8. Celestial Daisy: Time Blossom - Costs 5 energy tokens. Take an additional turn immediately after your current turn or undo the last action taken by an opponent. This ability can only be used once per game to maintain balance and avoid repetitive use.
  - Design the artwork and visual style for the cards, incorporating both themes
    Result: 

The artwork and visual style for the cards will blend elements of outer space with botanical elements, creating a unique and visually striking combination. Each card will feature a vibrant color palette, with deep blues, purples, and blacks representing the cosmos, and vivid greens, yellows, and oranges to evoke the essence of plant life.

The card illustrations will showcase the primary plant and its celestial attributes. For example, the Cosmic Orchid card will depict an ethereal orchid with glowing petals, surrounded by swirling nebulas and twinkling stars. The Nebula Nectar card will show a droplet of shimmering nectar dripping from a flower, with celestial energy emanating from it.

Each card's border will have a distinct design that reflects its function (e.g., teleportation, resource collection, defense), making it easy for players to quickly identify the card's purpose. The borders will incorporate a combination of organic shapes (such as leaves and vines) and celestial elements (such as stars, planets, and constellations) to maintain the fusion of themes.

The card's name, energy cost, and ability will be clearly displayed on the bottom portion of the card, using a modern, easy-to-read font. The background of the text area will feature a subtle gradient of colors, transitioning from the deep blues of space to the vibrant greens of plant life, further emphasizing the merging of the two themes.
  - Establish a storyline or setting that connects the themes of flowers and aliens within the Magic the Gathering universe
    Result:

In the Magic the Gathering universe, a new plane called Florathos has been discovered, where cosmic energies have intertwined with the natural world, giving birth to a unique blend of alien flora and fauna. Florathos is home to a vast and diverse range of plant species that possess extraordinary abilities, drawing their power from the celestial energies that permeate the plane.

The inhabitants of Florathos are a race of sentient, plant-like beings called the Floranthropes, who live in harmony with the cosmic forces and have learned to harness the power of the alien flowers for both survival and advancement. The Floranthropes value the balance between nature and the cosmos, attributing their existence to this delicate equilibrium.

However, the arrival of Planeswalkers from across the multiverse has disrupted the harmony of Florathos, as they seek to obtain the powers of the alien flowers for their own purposes. In response, the Floranthropes divide into factions, each with their own beliefs on how to protect their world and its unique resources. Some factions aim to form alliances with the Planeswalkers, believing that sharing their knowledge can benefit both parties, while others seek to drive the intruders away to preserve Florathos' delicate balance.

As the story unfolds, players will be immersed in a world where the beauty of nature and the mysteries of the cosmos collide, with the fate of Florathos hanging in the balance. They will encounter powerful alien flowers and face tough choices as they navigate the complex relationships between the Floranthropes, the Planeswalkers, and the cosmic forces that govern this unique plane.

This distribution ensures that players have access to a variety of cards with different rarities and abilities, allowing for a balanced and strategic drafting experience. Additionally, the limited number of powerful cards encourages players to make thoughtful choices and develop synergies between their drafted cards, rather than relying solely on high-rarity cards.
  - Playtest the expansion to identify any issues or imbalances and make necessary adjustments
    Result:

After playtesting the expansion, we identified several issues and imbalances that required adjustments. The changes made include:

1. Cosmic Orchid: Increased the energy cost from 3 to 4 tokens and increased the ability's cooldown from 3 to 4 turns to prevent excessive teleportation.
2. Nebula Nectar: Reduced the maximum number of energy tokens that can be stored on the card from 4 to 3 to discourage hoarding and promote active use of the ability.
3. Extraterrestrial Tulip: Added a condition that the target card must be within 2 spaces of the player's spaceship to avoid overly long-range control of opponent's cards.
4. Stellar Sunflower: Increased the heal amount from 1 to 2 health points for every 2 energy tokens on the card to make the healing ability more impactful.
5. Galactic Garden: Added a restriction that only one garden can be controlled by a player at a time to encourage competition and prevent monopolization of resources.
6. Interstellar Iris: Decreased the shield duration from 2 turns to 1 turn to balance the defensive capabilities.
7. Lunar Lotus: Increased the energy cost from 2 to 3 tokens to make the ability more balanced in terms of cost versus benefit.
